## Project Overview

This project is meant for Microsoft, which is contemplating the opportunity to tap into the movie industry. The datasets used for the provided research are from some of the most relevant movie websites such as IMDB.  The performed analysis is aimed at giving Microsoft a better understanding of the movie industry and get ahead with some key metrics. 

### Business Problem 

Microsoft sees a business opportunity to enter the movie industry and needs to get a better understanding of how to make successful movies to create a new stream of revenue.

### The Data

Two datasets were used:

*The IMDB data
  * `movie_basics` and `movie_ratings` 
The csv file
  * `movie budgets`

### Key Points

3 key metric points:

![]('P1%20images/Avg%20Ratings%20per%20genre.png')
![]('P1%20images/Avg%20Budget%20per%20genre.png')


### Conclusion

The datasets used to perform the analysis lead to 3 recommendations given to Microsoft in order for them to consider entering the movie industry: 
I. The release period is of prime importance.
II. Microsoft should consider the highest rated movie genres.
III. An accurate analysis of budget is needed in order to avoid overspending (it is easy to overspend and it is not necessarily worth it!).

### A Step Further

Based on the data provided, we could perform a deeper analysis in order to generate more insights:

I. More details on budget/ratings ratios (for more accurate budget projections). 
II. More details on genres combinations.
III. Research on directors, actors, ... that would help get a higher ROI.
